#Limpalair Stripe for Laravel

A simple and lightweight interface for Stripe's payment system. Easily create one-time charges to customers, and create customers in Stripe, without requiring that you save any of the information on your servers. This makes installation and implementation as easy as it gets.

Functionality might expand in the future. If you'd like to help, please let me know.

This has been tested on Laravel 5 and 5.1.
