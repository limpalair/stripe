#Limpalait Stripe for Laravel

This package provides a simple and lightweight interface for Stripe's payment system. It is currently useful to create one-time charges to customers, and create customers in Stripe, without requiring that you save any of the information on your servers. This makes installation and implementation as easy as it gets.

Functionality will hopefully expand in the future. If you'd like to help, please let me know.
